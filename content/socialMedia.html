<h1>
	Call for Social Media Coordinator</h1>
<p>
Greetings,
</p>
<p>
Organization is well under way for the 2013 Broadening Participation in Data Mining program (BPDM).  This year many changes are taking place.  Most notably, 2013 will begin our new collaboration with the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), instead of SDM.  This year's KDD conference will be hosted in August in Chicago, IL and our program will span two days.
</p>
<p>
Another notable change will be our presence and use of social media to support the program.  So we are in search of our first <strong>Social Media Coordinator</strong>.  This individual will have the chance to greatly shape pre, post, and in-time social media interaction for the program.  Responsibilities are listed below.
