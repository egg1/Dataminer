	<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Welcome to the <b>Broadening Participation in Data Mining</b> website. Our primary aim is to foster mentorship, guidance, and connections of minority and underrepresented groups in Data Mining, while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure. We provide venues in which to encourage students from such groups to connect with junior and senior researchers in industry, academia, and government. We hope to create and help grow meaningful lasting connections between researchers, thereby strengthening the Data Mining Community.</span></p>
