<p>
	<a name=\"faq5\"></a> <strong>5. What are the objectives and structure of BPDM?</strong></p>
<p style=\"padding-left: 16px;\">
	The main objective of BPDM is to mentor, guide, and advance applicants from underrepresented groups to become successful researchers in Data Mining, by providing career mentoring advice and discipline-specific overviews of past accomplishments and future research directions in the field. Specifically, the program will primarily focus on helping young researchers at the graduate and post-graduate level become knowledgeable and connected in research and research paradigms of Data Mining. This program is the first of its kind in Data Mining aimed directly at fostering mentorship, guidance, and aptitude of underrepresented groups.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 16px;\">
	The structure of the program is geared to provide students with opportunities to learn, share, and connect.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Learn - students will attend various panels and featured talks which will address common issues and advancements in Data Mining.</li>
	<li>
		Share and Connect - various networking breaks and sessions will allow students to connect with mentors and peers, share their research, and expand their personal network.</li>
</ol>
<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 16px;\">
	In order to provide students with relevant and appropriate material, the organizers have targeted respected and leading members of the community who have mentoring experience and who also come from underrepresented groups.</p>
