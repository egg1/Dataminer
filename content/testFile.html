<p>Welcome to the <b>Broadening Participation in Data Mining</b> website. Our primary aim is to foster mentorship, guidance, and connections of minority and underrepresented groups in Data Mining, while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure. We provide venues in which to encourage students from such groups to connect with junior and senior researchers in industry, academia, and government. We hope to create and help grow meaningful lasting connections between researchers, thereby strengthening the Data Mining Community.</p>
<br />
<p>
	Our first meeting is scheduled for <b>April 27-28, 2012</b>, co-located with <a href=\"http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm12/\">SDM 2012</a> in <b>Anaheim, CA</b> and our keynote speaker is <a href=\"http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/\">Dr. Vipin Kumar</a>. More detailed information regarding the workshop will be provided in the upcoming months.</p>

	<b>Vipin Kumar</b> is currently William Norris Professor and Head of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. His current research interests include data mining, high-performance computing, and their applications in Climate/Ecosystems and Biomedical domains. His research has resulted in the development of the concept of isoefficiency metric for evaluating the scalability of parallel algorithms, as well as highly efficient parallel algorithms and software for sparse matrix factorization (PSPASES) and graph partitioning (METIS, ParMetis, hMetis). Kumar is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE and AAAS.</p>
